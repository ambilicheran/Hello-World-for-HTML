      “Look—” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. Something bright
      white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn
      all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so{" "}
      <em>beautiful and sad</em>. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd
      angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread <i>early-white</i> on
      the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering
      sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing
      quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling
      across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood
      transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over
      the wound in the animal’s side, and began to drink its <b>blood</b>.{" "}
      <strong>“AAAAAAAAAAARGH!”</strong> Malfoy let out a terrible scream and
      bolted—so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at
      Harry—unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and
      came swiftly toward Harry—he couldn’t move for fear.
