        <li>2 tbsp ghee</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder</li>
        <li>450g paneer, cut into 3cm cubes</li>
        <li>500g spinach, mature fresh or frozen</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>thumb-sized piece of ginger</li>
        <li>
          1 green chilli, roughly chopped, (include seeds for extra spice)
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>Â½ lemon, juiced, to serve</li>

          Melt the ghee, whisk in with the turmeric and chilli powder, then add
          the cubed paneer and toss well. Set aside. If using frozen spinach,
          microwave for 3-5 mins, then place in a sieve and squeeze out most of
          the water. If using fresh spinach, place in a colander, pour over
          boiling water, drain and cool, then put in a tea towel and squeeze out
          most of the water. Roughly chop.

          Blitz the onion with the garlic, ginger and green chilli. Cook the
          paneer in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat for around 8
          mins, tossing the pan so they become golden all over. Remove and set
          aside on a plate, leaving spices behind in the pan. Tip the onion mix
          into the pan, add a pinch of salt and turn the heat down. Fry until
          caramel coloured, around 10 mins, adding a splash of water if it looks
          a little dry. Add the garam masala, stir to coat the onion mix, fry
          for 2 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the spinach and cook for a further 2-3 mins, adding 100ml water to
          release all the flavours from the bottom of the pan. Add the paneer
          and cook for 2-3 mins to heat through. Spoon into bowls and squeeze
          over a little lemon juice, to serve.
