        It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen
        anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at

        the dark leaves.

        Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him
        freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . .
        . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the
        ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood

      its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry—he couldn’t
      move for fear.
